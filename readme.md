## pygame spaceblaster
The original code comes from Tech with Tim tutorial: [Pygame for beginners in 90 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO6qQDNa2UY)

### Additions
I have made a few small modifications to use the pygame Rect properties for the display surface size and calculating the sprite size and coordinate.
this is merely just to make it easier to understand without having to add so many calculations.
